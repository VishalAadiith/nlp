#Person1#: Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building?
#Person2#: The Cross Bakery building? Oh sure. You're actually walking in the opposite direction.
#Person1#: Oh, you're kidding! I thought I was heading east.
#Person2#: No, east is the other direction. To get to the Bakery, you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway. When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm, you hang a left. Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left.
#Person1#: Okay, let me see if I've got that. I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway, then I make a left and the building is on my left hand side. Is that right?
#Person2#: Yeah, you've got it. Do you want me to show you the way?
